# Project Proposal

## Title
Gaming App for Finding Friends

## Nickname
GAFF

## Description 

GAFF is an website designed to help gamers find friends to play games with. Most games are more fun with a friend, 
but it can sometimes be hard to find people that play the type of games you are interested in. On our site, you can 
select a broad category like "FPS" or "MMORPG" to find friends, or you can choose more specific games that you are looking to play.
The website will display a list of people who want to play similar games to you, allowing you to quickly communicate and set up a game.
The goal of this site is to bring players together so anyone can create a community and meet new friends in whatever games they enjoy.
