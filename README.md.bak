# Project Proposal

## Title
Gaming App for Finding Friends

## Nickname
GAFF

## Description 

We are creating an app to help gamers find friends to play games with. You can select between
a broad category like "FPS" or "MMORPG" to find friends, or you can choose more specific games that
you are looking to play. Humans are social creatures and they crave to have fun with all kinds of friends,
but it can sometimes be hard to find people that play games that you are interested in. This is what our app 
is trying to bridge, the goal of the app is to bring gamers together to create a community that 
is something to be proud of. The app will display a list of people who want to play similar games to you, allowing you
to quickly communicate and set up a game of your choice.
